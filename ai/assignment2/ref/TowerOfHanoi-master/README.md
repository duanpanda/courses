## Tower of Hanoi

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

1. Only one disk may be moved at a time.
1. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
1. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## How to play

This game is meant more as an exercise in graphics than a *game* persay.  Once you have selected the number of disks you want on the tower you can hit "solve" to have the system automatically solve the puzzle for you.  In the future there will be a mode allowing you to solve the game yourself; however, until that time tihs is an automagic system. 

## Planned features

1. Solve it yourself
2. Timed solving
3. Score tracking
