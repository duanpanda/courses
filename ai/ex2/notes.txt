* In Python, = does reference assignment
* list methods cannot be invoked on literal list, e.g.
  [1,2].append(3) does not return [1,2,3] but returns nothing,
  while x = [1,2] and then x.append(3) returns [1,2,3], and x becomes [1,2,3]
* as a good practice, always use a variable to capture the return value from a function call
