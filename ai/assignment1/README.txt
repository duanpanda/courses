All were done by myself, with some online searching for reference as help.

The database problem, I gave my naive initial solution and the reference
solution with my comment.  The key is the Meta-call predicate call(:Goal).

The identifier problem, without help of the reference solution, I could not
finish it.  But now I understand the problem and the solution. :)

Tested on normal quries and against some boundary conditions.
