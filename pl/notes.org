* Why can we reuse labels in a record declaration, i.e. tree
  Is it a type or kind of variable?

* What is an unclosed list?
  like this: a|b|c|nil

* What is H|_?

* declare ... in ...? Scope?

* Why declare symbolA symbolB then fun {symbolA}? forward declaration?
  Forward declaration is needed when we use an undefined symbol (i.e. function).

* Is {Times L N} tail recursion?
  I don't think so.
