1. Implemented in Oz and Common Lisp, tested thoroughly in Common Lisp using
the unit test framework.

2. Tried to do the tail recursion optimization.

3. 
Bubble Sort in Oz is from
http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithms/Bubble_sort .

* I learned the usage of the output argument from that program.

* Main difficulty in Pure functional Bubble Sort:
How to do multiple outputs in a function or procedure?
Now I know how to do this.

Bubble Sort in Common Lisp was done by myself.

4. My GitHub repository which contains the submitted code.
