* multifield value
a series of zero or more fields contained together is referred to as a
multifield value

* slots: symbolic fields

* fact: relation name (a symbolic field) + zero or more slots

* how to get the value in a slot?
by variables and unification

* In deftemplate, we can use 'field' keyword and 'slot' keyword, diff?

* It seems the variables are global, e.g., bind ?gs in rule A, it can be accessed in rule B
No.  ?gs in rule A contributes to new rule that contains ?gs, rule B does not
use ?gs directly but uses the new rule that was introduced by rule A.
