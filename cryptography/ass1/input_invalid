if continents were dogs, europe would win best in show. the landmass is a seemingly perfect combination of pristine beaches, charming villages, historic cities and stunning nature. there is so much to see that planning a trip can be overwhelming... mostly because it is overwhelmingly expensive. but good news, now is arguably one of the best times to visit europe we have seen in years. and it is not just because the euro is at its lowest level in over a decade. flight prices are on the predicted decline, as well. airfare experts, including expedia and the airlines reporting corporation, foresee that given the falling price of fuel and the rise of budget airlines, airfare will get cheaper in 2015. what is more, a recent report from these experts found that the cheapest time to buy international flights is about 171 days before a trip.
